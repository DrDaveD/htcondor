series.

The details of each version are described below.

  :jira:`473`

Version 9.0.1
-------------

Release Notes:

.. HTCondor version 9.0.1 released on Month Date, 2021.

- HTCondor version 9.0.1 not yet released.

- The installer for Windows will now replace the ``condor_config``
  file even on an update.  You must use condor_config.local or
  a configuration directory to customize the config if you wish
  to preserve configuration changes across updates.

- The is a known issue with installer for Windows where it does
  not honor the Administrator Access list set in the MSI permissions
  dialog on a fresh install.  Instead is will always set the
  Administrator access to the default value.

New Features:

- When the ``AssignAccountingGroup`` configuration template is in effect
  and a user submits a job with a requested accounting group that they are not
  permitted to use, the submit will be rejected with an error message.
  This configuration template has a new optional second argument that can be used
  to quietly ignore the requested accounting group instead.
  :jira:`426`

- Added the OpenBLAS environment variable ``OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS`` to the list
  of environment variables exported by the *condor_starter* per these
  `recommendations <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq#how-can-i-use-openblas-in-multi-threaded-applications>`_.
  :jira:`444`

- HTCondor now parses ``/usr/share/condor/config.d/`` for configuration before
  ``/etc/condor/config.d``, so that packagers have a convenient place to adjust
  the HTCondor configuration.
  :jira:`45`

- Added a boolean option ``LOCAL_CREDMON_TOKEN_USE_JSON`` for the local issuer
  *condor_credmon_oauth* that is used to decide whether or not the bare token
  string in a generated access token file is wrapped in JSON. Default is
  ``LOCAL_CREDMON_TOKEN_USE_JSON = true`` (wrap token in JSON).
  :jira:`367`

- Windows MSI installer now sets up user-based authentication and creates 
  an IDTOKEN for local administration.
  :jira:`407`

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug where sending an updated proxy to an execute node could
  cause the *condor_starter* to segfault when AES encryption was enabled
  (which is the default).
  :jira:`456`
  :jira:`490`

- Fixed a bug in the implementation of the submit commands ``max_retries``
  and ``success_exit_code`` which would cause jobs which exited on a
  signal to go on hold (instead of exiting or being retried).
  :jira:`430`

- Fixed a bug with jobs that require running on a different machine
  after a failure by referring to MachineAttrX attributes in their
  requirements expression.
  :jira:`434`

- Fixed a memory leak in the job router, usually triggered when job
  policy expressions cause removal of the job.
  :jira:`408`

- Fixed a bug in the way ``AutoClusterAttrs`` was calculated that could
  in matchmaking ignoring attributes changed by ``job_machine_attrs``.
  :jira:`414`

- Fixed a bug in *condor_submit* when a ``SEC_CREDENTIAL_PRODUCER`` was
  configured that could result in *condor_submit* reporting that the
  Queue statement of a submit file was missing or invalid.
  :jira:`427`

- Fixed some bugs that caused ``bosco_cluster --add`` to fail.
  Allow ``remote_gahp`` to work with older Bosco installations via
  the ``--rgahp-script`` option.
  Fixed security authorization failure between *condor_gridmanager*
  and *condor_ft-gahp*.
  :jira:`438`
  :jira:`433`
  :jira:`451`
  :jira:`452`
  :jira:`487`

- Fixed a bug in the local issuer *condor_credmon_oauth* where SciTokens version
  2.0 tokens were being generated without an "aud" claim. The "aud" claim is now
  set to ``LOCAL_ISSUER_TOKEN_AUDIENCE``. The "ver" claim can be changed from
  the default of "scitokens:2.0" by setting ``LOCAL_ISSUER_TOKEN_VERSION``.
  :jira:`445`

- Fixed several bugs that could result in the *condor_token_* tools aborting with
  a c++ runtime error on newer versions of Linux.
  :jira:`449`

  In this version the tool for a few things related to the change to a more secure configuration by default.
  :jira:`384`

- The *condor_gpu_discovery* tool now defaults to using ``-short-uuid`` form for GPU ids on machines
  where the CUDA driver library has support for them. A new option ``-by-index`` has been added
  to select index-based GPU ids.
